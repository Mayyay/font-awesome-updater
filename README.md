# Font Awesome Updater
Making it easy to export Font Awesome icon names to a JSON file, ideal for use with icon pickers and more!

## Usage

* Clone the repo
* Run `node index.js`

A file named `icons.json` will appear in the repository folder.

## Future Improvements

This is extremely basic and was hacked together in an hour to speed up getting icon names as a JSON file.

These wont necessarily ever happen, but I think they would be nice to have one day.

* Publish on NPM
* Once on NPM: export the file in the current directory
* Add version support for Font Awesome
